# Pinpoint

A server for [OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org/) with several enhancements over a standard MQTT broker:

- Generate Registration Links
- Choose which users can see your location
- Device management
- Groups (coming soon)

## Installation

The recommended and supported installation method is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). It is highly recommended that you host Pinpoint behind a reverse proxy that handles SSL/TLS, my personal favorite is [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/v2).

```yaml
